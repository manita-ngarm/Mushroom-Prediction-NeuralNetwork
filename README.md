# Mushroom-Prediction-NeuralNetwork

Created the split_data.py to prepare and split the data into train, validate and test dataset 
Saved result all 3 files which are training.txt, val.txt, and testing.txt.

formula.py file, There are Sigmoid function, Derivative of neural activation function, Squared error function, and Derivative of squared error function

models.py file, 

  - The eval function compute the output of the layer nodes by using the sigmoid function which is defined in formula.py.
  
  - The backprop function calculate update weights by using derivative of neural activation function with learning rate. 
  
pro_test.py file, they are iterating through the neural network with each dataset.
